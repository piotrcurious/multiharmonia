use old ps2 pc keyboard and esp32 as microtonal mind bender

Dreamed by bing AI.
Idea is to use knobs to quickly set up harmonic scale
then press keys to use it. 
Consonant row is a row with consonant tones
dissonant row is a row with dissonant tones

Base granularity knob defines granularity of the scale
Base frequency selects base frequency of the scale based on granularity selected
Consonant frequency knob  selects frequency spacing of consonants 
dissonant frequency knob selects frequency spacing of dissonants
offset knob allows to get an extra row of dissonant frequencies for extra harmonic effects 

Perhaps vector row would be also useful (allowing to shift the keys in a vector way, f.e. transposing it one octave up or just one interval or offset up)

untested, may wake up Cthulhu. use at own risk!
